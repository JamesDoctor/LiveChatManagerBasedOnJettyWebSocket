Part A. Basic Demo
1. The Jetty Server is based on https://github.com/jetty-project/embedded-jetty-websocket-examples/tree/master/javax.websocket-example ;
2. Use Eclipse to import the existing maven project, choose the folder ".../LiveChatManager" as your project;
3. Build the project and run the ".../LiveChatManager/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/demo/Entry.java" as Java Application in Eclipse;
4. Goto ".../WebPages", open "ExampleCompanyAgentPage.html" in Chrome (or other browsers that can support H5 websocket):
(1) This page displays the total count of online customers in the header;
(2) For each online customer, there will be a row in left of the page. Each row shows the customerId and the count of unread messages from this customer;
(3) Clicking a customer's row will let the chat dialog box for this customer show up in right of the page. Once this dialog box comes out, the unread messages of corresponding customer will become 0. And this customer's row will change to green;
(4) If a customer has unread messages > 0, this customer's row will change to red. Otherwise, if the chat dialog box for this customer does not show up, then this customer's row will be grey (which is also the initial color once a customer becomes online).
5. Goto ".../WebPages", open "ExampleClientWebPage.html" in Chrome (or other browsers that can support H5 websocket), click "Start Chat" button;
6. Now, you can chat.


P.S.
1. The json parsing code is from https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java ;
2. You need to download lombok.jar from https://projectlombok.org/ , then go to your eclipse project, right click to edit the "Properties -> Java Build Path -> Add External JARs... -> add your downloaded lombok.jar".

-----------------------------------------------------

Part B. Add a javascript snippet into a customer web page to enable the live chat
Suppose there is a raw customer web page like ".../WebPages/rawClientWebPage.html":
1. Open this raw customer web page in an editor;
2. Before "</body>" in this web page, insert the snippet in ".../WebPages/toInsertJS.html" (then the raw customer web page will have the contents like ".../WebPages/rawClientWebPageWithToInsertJSAdded.html");
3. Now open the modified customer web page, and you will see the live chat widget, and you can use it to chat with company agent (if both server is running, and company agent web page is opened).

-----------------------------------------------------

All the webpages have been tested in IE-11, FireFox-45.4.0, Chrome-53.0.2785.143 m (64-bit)
